This App is list of Products using Swift and SwiftUI for UI.

## UI
- Screens:
 1- Product List page
 2- Product Details Page
 3- Favourites Page

The UI is very simple as it's required. List and each cell has the image, name, price, and button to add to the car of the product


## Design
- The App is simple and hasn't many flows, so MVVM would do great.
